      <p>
        The first known prisons weren’t built for punishment the way we understand it today.
        In ancient Mesopotamia, temple and state authorities operated early detention centers called “Houses of Confinement.”
        These spaces existed as far back as 3200 BCE, used not just to detain accused individuals, but to extract labor, collect debts, and await ritual trials or legal decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Codes like that of Ur-Nammu and Hammurabi mention imprisonment as a step in legal or spiritual processing.
        In hymns to Nungal, the Mesopotamian goddess of prisons, incarceration was framed as a spiritual ordeal, refining the soul through hardship, like metal in fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        These were the first known spaces built to contain people through state power. They introduced ideas that carried through millennia: that confinement could punish, correct, and morally restore.
        They weren’t just early jails; they were foundational to the entire timeline of prison history, merging justice, control, and symbolic rehabilitation in one system.
