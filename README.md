HELLO EVERYONE
This is my first time ever trying to code a website, and to be truthfully honest, I have no clue what I am doing!! Co-Pilot is helping me a LOT!

However, I am excited for where this journey takes me and really hope this website can show off my technical, artistic, and misc. skills that I have gained at my time in college.
SHORT SUMMARY OF ME (DATE 5-21-25)
I am currenty 23 years old and I am about to start my last semester of school ever! I am an architecture student at SDSU (South Dakota) in the accelerated masters program. This will be my fifth and a-half semester, and will be a very quick 10 weeks. 
After that, I will need a job and I have already started looking with very little luck. I hope this project helps build some credibility on what I am able to do and acomplish over all aspects of my field, not just design (although I do pride myself on my designs)

GOALS
I had 3 major goals for the entire site, be easily accessible, showcase my portfolio, and showcase my 3d print files and eventual 3D print shop. 

My overall inspiration for the site is BIG.dk - one of my favorite firms, but I took lots of inspiration. 
All projects within portfolio are completed by myself and sometimes others, depending on the project. Each project goes into depth on this.
All 3D prints are designed 100% by me, using Illustrator, Photoshop, Rhino3D, and more. 

I have built a website before, but never through coding, only through a website builder, however I feel somewhat this is more meaningful and I am starting to understand how everything works together. Thanks everyone!
