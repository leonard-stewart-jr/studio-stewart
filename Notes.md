Sidebar and HeaderBar as of [today’s date] are working perfectly.
- Do NOT change their hamburger position or animation.
- Tomorrow, we will work on Sidebar text, project text, and add project images.
- Keep the current navigation and header logic as-is.
- Any changes should only affect Sidebar/project text/images—not the header/sidebar structure or logo/hamburger logic.
