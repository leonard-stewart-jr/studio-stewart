One of the first prisons built specifically for rehabilitation, the Maison de Force was commissioned by city officials in 1557 to reflect more progressive values; it focused on structured reform through labour rather than physical punishment.

The facility was designed with separate quarters for men, women, and debtors, and operated under a strict regime of silence, routine, and moral instruction; inmates spun wool, wove textiles, and participated in daily workshops, shared refectories, and chapel services.

Its location adjacent to Ghent’s medieval Gravensteen Castle made it a tangible symbol of a new prison logic in the late 16th century; where the state aimed to correct rather than simply threaten or punish.

While critics later described it as overly militarized, the Maison de Force laid the foundation for modern European prisons by blending isolation with enforced labour and moral order; it influenced Enlightenment-era penal philosophies across the continent.

        content: `
In 1791, philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham proposed the Panopticon, a circular prison design that allowed one guard to observe all inmates from a central tower, while remaining unseen. The core idea was that prisoners would never know when they were being watched, so they would begin to monitor their own behavior. This created a system of psychological control through visibility, not force.

The structure was designed so that all cells faced inward, wrapping around a central inspection tower. The observer inside the tower could see out, but prisoners could not see in; there were blinds and architectural tricks that maintained one-way visibility. Prisoners were isolated from each other, placed in rows of identical cells, and kept under the assumption of constant surveillance.

Bentham believed this model could apply beyond prisons—he suggested it could be used in schools, factories, hospitals, and asylums. His brother Samuel experimented with parts of the design while working for the British navy, but no true Panopticon was built during Bentham’s life.

Even though it stayed mostly on paper, the Panopticon theory left a legacy. It changed how prisons were imagined—less about physical confinement and more about mental discipline. Later thinkers like Michel Foucault used the Panopticon as a symbol for modern systems of control, where power operates invisibly but constantly, training people to police themselves.

Bentham was also one of the key proponents of Utilitarianism, the ethical theory that maximizes happiness and well-being, or the greatest good for the greatest number.

        content: `
After Bentham’s Panopticon proposed that architecture itself could control behavior, the nineteenth century became the testing ground for prisons that turned this idea into physical form. Across Europe and the Americas, new facilities were designed not just to confine but to dominate space; to watch, isolate, and restructure daily life through layout alone.

Pentonville Prison in London, and Moabit Prison in Berlin, used radial planning with long corridors branching from a central surveillance point, enforcing silence, routine, and individual isolation. Prision Modelo in Madrid refined the radial idea with a central chapel, layered circulation, and segmented wings that echoed both religious and inspection-based order. American examples like the First Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, and Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, used linear wings or spoke-like cells to enforce solitary confinement as moral correction, with every inmate treated as both a body to monitor and a mind to reform.

Maison de Force in Ghent was retrofitted into a militarized star layout; it maintained gender separation, chapel-centered circulation, and work zones designed for control through labor. The National Penitentiary in Mexico City, and the Central Prison in St Petersburg, applied the same geometry on a larger scale with mechanical additions like central plumbing, heating, and rigid security routes; proving the Panopticon theory was no longer a concept; it was a global structure.

In each case, the floorplan became the primary instrument of control; space itself punished, trained, and observed. These were not just buildings, they were full-scale diagrams of the state’s power.

Building on the shift toward surveillance-based and radial layouts, Eastern State Penitentiary brought the logic of spatial discipline into the American context; conceived by reformers including Benjamin Franklin and designed by architect John Haviland, it introduced the Pennsylvania System where solitary confinement was meant to lead to moral clarity through isolation and silence.

Constructed across eleven acres and enclosed by thirty-foot granite walls, the prison used modern technologies like central heating, indoor plumbing, and skylights in each cell—called “Windows of God”—to encourage spiritual reflection and personal transformation.

Its spoke-shaped design radiated seven long corridors from a central hub, allowing a small number of guards to silently watch over hundreds of inmates; the building itself became the method of discipline, replacing punishment with stillness and unseen control.

Eastern State became one of the most influential prisons in global history; authors like Charles Dickens documented their visits, and over three hundred institutions copied its model before the rise of overcrowding led to the breakdown of solitary systems; it closed in 1971 but remains a preserved ruin that continues to tell the story of how architecture once shaped the soul.

By the mid nineteenth century, Britain turned to convict transportation as a tool for both punishment and imperial expansion; the colonies served not just as destinations for the “undesirable” but as spaces of forced labor and territorial control.

Australia became the most significant site of this strategy; from 1788 to 1868, over 162,000 convicts were shipped to the continent, many ending up in Port Arthur, Tasmania—a place reserved for repeat offenders and escapees, where labor included grinding flour by treadmill and timber cutting under conditions of silence and surveillance.

India and South Africa also absorbed transported prisoners who were used in public works, mining, and infrastructure—tying incarceration to imperial logistics; while less centralized than Australia’s system, they represented the same logic: punishment as utility.

Though later criticized for moral cruelty and harsh discipline, these colonies redefined incarceration as a form of economic extraction and spatial dominance; they left behind ruins, administrative systems, and reform movements that carried their impact far beyond their original function.

Following Adolf Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, Nazi Germany established a vast system of concentration camps across Germany and occupied Europe; these were not conventional prisons, but instruments of terror, labor, and extermination, operated outside the legal system and intended to silence political enemies, marginalize targeted groups, and later, implement the Final Solution.

The first camp, Dachau, opened near Munich just weeks after Hitler became chancellor; initially created for political dissidents, it quickly became a model for hundreds more. The SS developed a tiered hierarchy of camps—transit, labor, and death—each designed to extract labor, inflict punishment, or conduct mass killings. Auschwitz, the largest and most infamous, functioned as all three; its design included electrified fencing, crematoria, gas chambers, forced barracks, and guard towers, making it an architecture of systemic annihilation.

These camps operated beyond the framework of justice; no trials were held, and prisoners included Jews, Roma, homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, disabled people, Poles, Soviets, and others deemed enemies by the Nazi regime. Some camps emphasized psychological control through humiliation and overcrowding; others, like Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen, operated factories and quarries using slave labor.

By 1945, an estimated 18 million people had passed through the Nazi camp system; over six million were murdered, many within these institutions. The legacy of this carceral structure fundamentally altered global human rights law, postwar justice systems, and prison ethics—serving as a permanent warning of how incarceration can become genocide under state ideology.

During the 1960s and 70s, Norway and Sweden became international leaders in penological reform, rejecting punishment-centered incarceration in favor of systems rooted in rehabilitation, education, and dignity. These changes were shaped by rising social-democratic values and a regional commitment to social justice.

In Sweden, a major prison strike in 1970 supported by the advocacy group KRUM brought national attention to inhumane prison conditions and inspired legal reforms that emphasized non-custodial alternatives, including probation, community service, and restorative justice. While changes rolled out gradually, these ideas shaped national policies into the 1980s and beyond.

In Norway, reform became visible through architecture itself. Prisons moved away from bars and block layouts in favor of open shared kitchens, educational spaces, and human-centered environments. Halden Prison, opened in 2010 though planned decades earlier, was designed by Erik Møller Architects and HLM Architects. It became the most complete expression of these ideas, featuring private rooms with natural light, job training, and active daily schedules.

This Scandinavian model—later adopted by Denmark and Finland—demonstrated significantly lower recidivism and reflected a broader political strategy to connect social equity with justice. The prison was no longer imagined as a tool of vengeance but a space of social repair, trust, and re-entry.
